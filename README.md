# Electricity-Consumption
Units of electricity consumption are given in the form of a matrix in source data. You are required to write user-defined functions and create a repeating menu in Python or C++ keeping in mind the following requirements:

1. The student's ID should be displayed at the top of the menu.

2. Press 1 to display the bill of slab 1 and slab 2. (Hint: In slab 1, the unit range is 0 to 100, each unit costs Rs. 10, and the data of slab 1 is in the first row of the matrix. While in slab 2, the unit range is 101-200, each unit costs Rs.15, and the data of slab 2 is in the second row of the matrix)

3. Press 2 to display the bill of slab 3.(Hint: In slab 3, the unit range is 201 to 300, each unit costs Rs.20, and the data of slab 3 is in the third row of the matrix.)

4. Press any other key to exit.

Source data:

(Use two-dimensional array to store the following matrix)

55

65

75

120

150

170

210

240.

Instructions to write Python / C++ program:

• Use the given source data. If you do not use it, your marks will be deducted.

• Write functions to calculate and display cost for slab 1, slab 2, and slab 3 from the given source matrix.

The following function names should be used for consistency.

To calculate and display cost for slab 1: costSlab1();

To calculate and display cost for slab 2: costSlab2();

To calculate and display cost for slab 3: costSlab3();
